    + Help class
    + Basic help (country list, weapon specs, keybindings, getting started etc...)

Other Things
    + [ DONE ] Make events call methods of an Events.Event() instance, instead of static methods in Events()
    + [ DONE ] silos only store weapons that they've got in the 'contents' array
    + [ DONE ] Check for home region population <= 0 (win)
    + [ DONE ] When a silo is hit, each missile has an x% chance of being lost (window.gamevars.silo_weapon_loss)
    + Can move missiles between silos (takes prep time / movement time). If in blast range, can still be destroyed
    + [ DONE ] Content of message box is saved
    + [ DONE ] Can no longer see enemy events
    + [ DONE ] GameEvents are marked as done ON INITIATION rather than completion. Also add milliseconds to event IDs to avoid confusion
    + If any player looses focus, pause everything

Optimizations:
    + [ DONE ] Load sound using XMLHttp then create repository, so sound doesn't need to be loaded again every play (PlaySound)
    + < POSTPONED > Combine some JavaScript files to reduce HTTP requests       COMMENTS: maybe after production
